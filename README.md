# Predicting Rocket League Skillshots using Machine Learning

The task of this exercise originally was to use machine-learning to predict which rocket league skillshot was executed by analyzing the last 30 frames before the goal was scored. This task was then adapted to use FAIR principles and save the data on a server instead of locally to improve reproducability and maintainability.
